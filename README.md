## About

This was a story board I created from this forked CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/compassionate-gagarin-mqclcq?file=/style.css. It is the opening sequence of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series. I really love the gifs and pictures I found and that best matched the text. It's an amazing show and highly recommend to anyone who hasn't wathced it yet!

Built with HTML and CSS.
